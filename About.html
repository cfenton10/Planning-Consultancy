<h2>Military Thinking Meets Modern Business</h2>
<p>The Corporate Estimate is a planning consultancy built on the belief that businesses benefit most from structure, clarity, and operational precision. We bring the discipline and insight of military planning—specifically the <strong>Combat Estimate</strong>—to the corporate environment.</p>

<h2>What Is the Combat Estimate?</h2>
<p>The Combat Estimate is a battle-tested planning model used by military leaders to assess a complex situation, evaluate threats, allocate resources, and execute under pressure. We've adapted this model for business use, helping corporate leaders answer key planning questions with clarity:</p>

<ul>
<li>What is the objective?</li>
<li>What challenges stand in our way?</li>
<li>What assets can we deploy?</li>
<li>How can we act faster and smarter than the competition?</li>
</ul>

<p>Whether you're entering a new market, launching a product, or restructuring a division — our approach ensures you're operating with full situational awareness and purpose-driven action.</p>
